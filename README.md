### What Are Unblocked Games?

Unblocked games are online games that bypass network restrictions, such as firewalls or content filters, commonly found in schools, workplaces, or public Wi-Fi networks. These games are typically hosted on websites that are not blocked by network administrators, allowing users to access them without needing special software or permissions. They range from simple flash-based games to more complex HTML5 games, catering to a wide variety of interests and age groups.

The term ‚Äúunblocked‚Äù refers to the ability of these games to evade restrictions, making them accessible in environments where traditional gaming sites like Steam or console platforms are off-limits. Many unblocked games are browser-based, meaning they can be played directly on a web browser without requiring downloads or installations.
